#+TITLE: dired-rainbow-listing

This Emacs package adds customizable highlighting to =dired= listings. It works well alongside [[https://github.com/Fuco1/dired-hacks][dired-hacks]], 
and specifically [[https://github.com/Fuco1/dired-hacks#dired-rainbow][dired-rainbow]].

* Screenshot
[[file:screenshot.png]]
Notice the (somtimes subtile) coloring of the file attributes, user, group, date, etc. Also notice that file extensions are left un-highlighted to draw attention to the main part of the file name. I think it makes it easier and more pleasant to read and scan through.

* Install
** Manually
  Install it by cloning the repository
  #+begin_src sh
  git clone https://github.com/mnewt/dired-rainbow-listing ~/.emacs.d/lisp/
  #+end_src
  Add it to the =load-path=
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/lisp/dired-rainbow-listing")
  (require 'dired-rainbow-listing)
  (add-hook 'dired-mode-hook #'dired-rainbow-listing-mode)
  #+end_src

** Using straight.el
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
   (use-package dired-rainbow-listing
     :straight (:type git :host github :repo "mnewt/dired-rainbow-listing")
     :hook
     (dired-mode . dired-rainbow-listing-mode))
   #+end_src

* Prior Art
  This package was created to compliment [[https://github.com/Fuco1/dired-hacks][dired-hacks]]. Much of its functionality is similar to [[https://github.com/purcell/diredfl][diredfl]]. I created it as a replacement for =diredfl= that is compatible with =dired-rainbow=. And since I was designing it, I made it a little simpler and picked a default color scheme that I like better.
